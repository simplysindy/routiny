# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the technical foundation with working authentication, basic task input, and AI-powered breakdown functionality. This epic focuses on learning core full-stack development skills while building the fundamental features that prove the concept works.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a **developer**,
I want a fully configured Next.js project with TypeScript and essential dependencies,
so that I can begin building features with a solid technical foundation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Next.js 14 project initialized with App Router and TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS configured with mobile-first responsive design system
3. ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code quality
4. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore and README
5. Vercel deployment pipeline configured for continuous integration
6. Environment variable management setup for API keys and configuration
7. Basic folder structure established following Next.js best practices

## Story 1.2: Supabase Integration and Authentication

As a **user**,
I want to create an account and log in securely,
so that my tasks and progress are saved and synchronized across devices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Supabase project configured with PostgreSQL database and authentication
2. Magic link authentication flow implemented with email verification
3. User session management with automatic token refresh
4. Database tables created for users, tasks, and micro-steps
5. Supabase client configured for both server-side and client-side operations
6. Authentication state managed globally across the application
7. Secure logout functionality that clears all local data

## Story 1.3: Basic Task Input Interface

As a **user**,
I want to input tasks through a simple, clean interface,
so that I can quickly capture what I need to accomplish without friction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Clean, minimal task input form with text area for task description
2. Mobile-optimized interface with thumb-friendly touch targets
3. Input validation to prevent empty or excessively long task submissions
4. Loading states during task processing with clear user feedback
5. Error handling for network failures with retry functionality
6. Task history display showing recently created tasks
7. Responsive design that works across different screen sizes

## Story 1.4: OpenAI Integration for Task Breakdown

As a **user**,
I want my tasks automatically broken down into manageable micro-steps,
so that I can overcome procrastination and start taking action immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. OpenAI GPT-4 API integration with secure API key management
2. Prompt engineering to generate 5-7 actionable micro-steps consistently
3. API response processing to extract and format micro-steps
4. Error handling for API failures with meaningful user feedback
5. Response time optimization with appropriate timeout handling
6. Rate limiting implementation to manage API usage costs
7. Fallback responses for when AI service is unavailable

## Story 1.5: Step Display and Basic Interaction

As a **user**,
I want to see my micro-steps in an easy-to-follow format,
so that I can progress through them systematically and track my completion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Clean step-by-step display with numbered micro-steps
2. Interactive checkboxes for marking steps as complete
3. Visual progress indicator showing completion percentage
4. Step descriptions clearly formatted and easy to read on mobile
5. Completed steps visually distinguished from pending steps
6. Ability to view psychological rationale for each step ordering
7. Smooth animations for step completion transitions
