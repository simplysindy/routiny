# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a delightfully simple, mobile-first experience that feels more like a game than a productivity tool. The interface should eliminate cognitive overhead while providing immediate dopamine rewards through micro-accomplishments. Every interaction should feel effortless and encouraging, with the AI serving as a supportive companion rather than a cold algorithm.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Tap-to-complete**: Single tap interaction for step completion with satisfying visual feedback
- **Swipe gestures**: Intuitive swipe patterns for navigation and task management
- **Voice-first option**: Seamless voice input for hands-free task creation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show only essential information, reveal details on demand
- **Celebration moments**: Micro-animations and character reactions for completed actions

## Core Screens and Views

- **Task Input Screen**: Clean, minimal interface with prominent voice/text input
- **Task Breakdown View**: Step-by-step display with progress indicators and coach character
- **Streak Dashboard**: Visual progress tracking with achievement highlights
- **Settings/Profile**: User preferences and account management
- **Offline Mode Indicator**: Clear status display when operating without connectivity

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

- High contrast color schemes for readability
- Voice input as primary accessibility feature
- Screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements
- Minimum touch target sizes of 44px
- Alternative text for all visual feedback elements

## Branding

Warm, encouraging pixel-art aesthetic reminiscent of friendly retro gaming. Color palette emphasizes calming blues and energizing greens to promote both focus and accomplishment. Character design should feel supportive and non-judgmental, avoiding productivity guilt commonly associated with task management apps.

## Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only

Primary focus on iPhone with progressive enhancement. Optimized specifically for iOS Safari with PWA capabilities. All interactions designed for single-handed mobile use with thumb-friendly touch targets.
