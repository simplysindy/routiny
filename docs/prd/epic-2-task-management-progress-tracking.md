# Epic 2: Task Management & Progress Tracking

**Epic Goal:** Create robust task and progress management with offline capabilities. This epic teaches advanced web development concepts including offline-first architecture, data synchronization, and state management while building essential user-facing features.

## Story 2.1: Task Persistence and Data Management

As a **user**,
I want my tasks and progress automatically saved,
so that I never lose my work and can access it from any device.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Task data persisted to Supabase database with user association
2. Micro-steps stored with completion status and timestamps
3. Real-time synchronization between client and database
4. Automatic conflict resolution for simultaneous edits across devices
5. Data validation to ensure integrity of saved information
6. Efficient database queries optimized for mobile performance
7. Backup and recovery mechanisms for data protection

## Story 2.2: Task List and Management Interface

As a **user**,
I want to view and manage all my tasks in one place,
so that I can choose what to work on and track my overall progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Comprehensive task list showing all user tasks with status
2. Visual indicators for task completion percentage
3. Sorting and filtering options (by date, completion, priority)
4. Ability to delete completed or unwanted tasks
5. Quick access to resume partially completed tasks
6. Task overview showing total completed vs. pending items
7. Intuitive navigation between task list and individual task views

## Story 2.3: Offline Functionality and Local Storage

As a **user**,
I want the app to work without internet connection,
so that I can continue making progress on my tasks anywhere.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Service worker implementation for offline application functionality
2. Local storage of tasks and progress with IndexedDB
3. Background synchronization when connectivity is restored
4. Clear indicators when operating in offline mode
5. Conflict resolution for data modified offline and online simultaneously
6. Essential app functionality available without network connection
7. Graceful degradation of AI features when offline with cached suggestions

## Story 2.4: Progress Analytics and History

As a **user**,
I want to see my productivity patterns and achievements over time,
so that I can understand my progress and stay motivated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Daily, weekly, and monthly completion statistics
2. Visual charts showing productivity trends over time
3. Achievement metrics (total tasks completed, longest streak)
4. Historical view of completed tasks with timestamps
5. Performance insights highlighting most productive times
6. Export functionality for personal productivity data
7. Privacy-focused analytics stored locally and optionally synced
