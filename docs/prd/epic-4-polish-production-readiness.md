# Epic 4: Polish & Production Readiness

**Epic Goal:** Learn production-ready development practices including testing, performance optimization, error handling, and deployment automation. This epic transforms the application into a portfolio-worthy project that demonstrates professional development workflows and best practices.

## Story 4.1: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

As a **user**,
I want the app to load and respond instantly,
so that my productivity flow is never interrupted by technical delays.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Bundle size optimization achieving <100KB initial load
2. Image optimization and lazy loading for character animations
3. API response caching to reduce OpenAI API calls and costs
4. Database query optimization for fast task retrieval
5. Good Lighthouse scores demonstrating performance optimization skills
6. Basic performance monitoring to understand application behavior
7. Automated performance regression testing in deployment pipeline

## Story 4.2: Error Handling and User Experience

As a **user**,
I want clear, helpful feedback when something goes wrong,
so that I understand what happened and know how to proceed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Comprehensive error boundaries preventing app crashes
2. User-friendly error messages avoiding technical jargon
3. Automatic retry mechanisms for transient network failures
4. Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
5. Error reporting system for debugging and monitoring
6. Recovery suggestions provided for common error scenarios
7. Offline error handling with appropriate user guidance

## Story 4.3: Testing Framework and Quality Assurance

As a **developer**,
I want comprehensive testing coverage,
so that I can confidently deploy changes and maintain application reliability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Unit tests for critical business logic and utility functions
2. Integration tests for API endpoints and external service connections
3. Component testing for key user interface interactions
4. PWA functionality testing across different devices and browsers
5. Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
6. Test coverage reporting and quality gates
7. Manual testing checklists for complex user workflows

## Story 4.4: Production Deployment and Monitoring

As a **developer**,
I want automated deployment with comprehensive monitoring,
so that I can maintain application health and respond quickly to issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Automated deployment pipeline with staging and production environments
2. Environment-specific configuration management
3. Basic application monitoring to learn production practices
4. Error tracking and logging for debugging and learning
5. Database migration and backup strategies
6. Security scanning and vulnerability monitoring
7. Analytics integration for user behavior insights and feature usage
