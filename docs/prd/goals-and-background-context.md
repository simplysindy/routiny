# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Successfully develop first full-stack application using modern tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase)
• Master comprehensive development skills through building a complete, deployable product
• Create an AI-powered app that reduces procrastination by breaking tasks into micro-steps
• Learn PWA development with offline-first architecture and native mobile experience
• Gain experience with AI API integration and prompt engineering
• Build a functional, polished application that demonstrates full-stack development capabilities

## Background Context

Procrastination affects 87% of people who waste approximately 3.2 hours daily avoiding overwhelming tasks. Current productivity apps focus on organization rather than addressing the core psychological barrier of getting started. The primary friction point occurs when tasks appear as large, daunting chunks rather than manageable steps.

Routiny leverages GPT-4 AI to instantly decompose any user task into 5-7 micro-steps, with the first step designed to eliminate friction through environmental setup or material gathering. Combined with gamification elements (pixel-art coach, streaks, celebrations) and mobile-first PWA architecture, this creates a frictionless tool that addresses execution psychology rather than just task management.
