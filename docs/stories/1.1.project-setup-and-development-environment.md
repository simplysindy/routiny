## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-core-infrastructure.md]
This is the first story in Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure. Epic goal is to establish technical foundation with working authentication, basic task input, and AI-powered breakdown functionality. This story provides the essential technical foundation that all subsequent stories in the epic will build upon.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ with App Router and TypeScript 5.0+
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.0+ with mobile-first approach
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in tooling with Turbopack
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent standards
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library for component and unit tests
- **Deployment**: Vercel Git Integration for automated CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Sentry for performance tracking

### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Complete folder structure must be established:

```
routiny/
├── .github/workflows/          # CI/CD workflows
├── public/                     # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── app/                    # Next.js 14 App Router
│   ├── components/             # React components
│   ├── hooks/                  # Custom React hooks
│   ├── lib/                    # Utilities and config
│   ├── services/               # API service layer
│   ├── stores/                 # Zustand stores
│   └── types/                  # TypeScript definitions
├── pages/api/                  # API routes (pages dir for APIs)
├── docs/                       # Documentation
```

### Code Quality Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **Type Safety**: Shared types in `src/types/` directory
- **Environment Variables**: Access through config objects, never direct process.env

### Development Workflow Requirements

[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

- Next.js development server setup
- Hot reloading configuration
- Build and production optimizations
- Environment configuration templates

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
Testing structure must be established:

- Frontend tests in `src/__tests__/`
- Backend API tests in `pages/api/__tests__/`
- E2E tests in `e2e/` directory
- Testing pyramid: 40% frontend unit, 40% backend unit, 15% integration, 5% E2E

### Deployment Requirements

- Vercel platform integration
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Environment variable management across stages
- Performance monitoring setup

## Testing

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Set up Vitest as primary testing framework
- Configure Testing Library for component testing
- Establish test file organization structure
- Create initial setup for E2E testing with Playwright
- No specific tests needed for this story, focus on infrastructure setup
